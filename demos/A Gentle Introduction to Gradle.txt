A Gentle Introduction to Gradle
Why Another Build Tool?
+ Pressure for Customization
+ Continuous Deployment -> Automated Deployment to Production

declarative / imperative
Ant: alots of lines => imperative
Maven: inside maven pom file declare parameters about the build => declarative

conventions / adaptability
we like conventions, but we also like adapt/extend that tool to build new conventions

tasks (much like a Ant target)


plugins (25:30)
Chapter 22. Standard Gradle plugins
Language Plugins
java		Adds Java compilation, testing and bundling capabilities to a project
groovy/scala...
22.4 Software development plugins
eclipse		making it possible to import the project into Eclipse
findbugs		***
checkstyle		***
codenarc		***

Standard Maven Directory Format (30:45):
--- src
	---- main
		---- java

gradle build
--- build
	--- classes
		--- main
			--- org
				--- gradle
					--- poetry
						--- Poetry.class	*** Our Classes ***
	--- dependency-cache
	--- libs
		--- poetry.jar	*** JAR file ***
	--- reports			*** Tried to run Tests, but did not find ***
		--- tests
			--- base-style.css
			--- css3-pie-1.0beta3.htc
			--- index.html
			--- report.js
			--- style.css

### JavaExec defines JVM-Parameters
// task with type: tasks are objects and have an API
// task can inherit von task type JavaExec
task caesar(type: JavaExec) {
  main = 'org.gradle.poetry.Poetry'
  classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
  //JavaExec: JVM-Parameters: classpath,input/output-stream,heap
}
